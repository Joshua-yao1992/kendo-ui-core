# App

This project is created to test out integration of Kendo UI in WebPack.

The specific here is that the Webpack has been set up to inject jQuery and Kendo as global instances. This is done by using the `webpack.ProvidePlugin` and the `webpack.ProvideGlobalPlugin` plugins.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run the application
```
npm start
```
